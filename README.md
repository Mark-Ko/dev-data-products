# dev data products  

This is a repo containing my project for the Developing Data Products course in the Coursera Data Science specialization. 

My shiny app uses linear regression to model risk factors for low birth weight, using the _birthwt_ dataset from the **MASS** package.

The gh-pages branch of this repo contains the source code of my shiny app and the Rmd and html versions of my presentation.

You can run my app [here](https://mark-ko.shinyapps.io/myApp/).

You can view my presentation in your browser [here](http://mark-ko.github.io/dev-data-products/Birthweight.html).
